# NoguiTitles
Removes gui titles from block menus

NoguiTitles is an addon pack that removes the titles from every container gui in vanilla Minecraft. The player's inventory and the block's menu are now separated. Several block menus have been cut down to not take up so much unnecessary space. 

Using optifine allows shulkerbox guis to have their own texture based on their colors.
